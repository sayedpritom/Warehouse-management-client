Tasks left: 
Make all buttons work
add few animation
add sold in items data
navbar expand-lg




Optional but highly encourage:
Implement 401, 403 for JWT of the My Items page. Log out and send the user to the login page for these two statuses.
Try to use a better-looking confirmation dialogue other than the browser's default confirm.
On the Manage Inventory, create many items by duplicating your items and implementing pagination.


Optional
Add some animation while applicable.
Please Use icons whenever applicable and use fonts (google fonts). For example, for delete, you can use the delete icon. To add an item, you can use an add icon.
Make the footer a little more realistic
Optimize your images
Add something extra of your own. This will help you in the future during the job interview.
Also, if you want, you can use mongoose.
If possible, replace the default react favicon and give an icon for your website.
using axios is optional. If you are using axios, make sure you use the earlier version.
If possible give swr or react-query a try. This will be helpful in the future.
